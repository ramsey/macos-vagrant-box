## FAQs

### It won't boot. What's the problem?

If your host machine is not macOS, then it's very likely this won't run.
Attempting to run macOS on non-certified Apple hardware is a violation of their
EULA. I'm not able to help, if this is the case, so please do not open an issue.

### How do I get started?

You can quickly start using `vagrant init [box name]`. For example:

    vagrant init ramsey/macos-catalina

### How do I SSH to the VM?

Use the `vagrant ssh` command.

### How can I launch the GUI to click around in the macOS VM?

Add the following to your Vagrantfile:

``` ruby
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  vb.gui = true
end
```

If you've already started the VM, reload the configuration with
`vagrant reload`. VirtualBox will now launch the GUI, where you may log in
and click around.
